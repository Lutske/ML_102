#Step-by-Step Hands-On Guide: Deploying a Model on AWS
Total Duration: 15 minutes

1. Preparations 
Ensure Access: Confirm that you have access to the AWS Console

Provide Resources: Distribute a pre-trained model and sample data. This could be a simple machine learning model such as a pre-trained image classification or regression model.

2. Create an Amazon S3 Bucket 
Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Step 2: Navigate to Amazon S3 and click "Create bucket."
Step 3: Enter a unique bucket name and select the region closest to you.
Step 4: Leave the default settings and click "Create."
Purpose: This bucket will store the machine learning model and any data needed for inference.

3. Upload the Model to S3 
Step 1: Select the newly created bucket and click "Upload."
Step 2: Click "Add files," select the pre-trained model file from your computer, and then click "Upload."
Purpose: The model needs to be accessible in S3 for deployment via SageMaker.

4. Set Up SageMaker Model 
Step 1: Open the Amazon SageMaker console.
Step 2: Under "Inference," select "Models" and then "Create model."
Step 3: Name your model, and under "IAM role," select or create a role that has access to your S3 bucket.
Step 4: Under "Primary container," specify the location of the Docker container image that will serve the model (this can be an image provided by AWS for common model types).
Step 5: For the "Model data location," provide the S3 path where your model file is stored.
Purpose: Sets up the infrastructure needed to host and serve the model.

5. Create an Endpoint
Step 1: Still in SageMaker, navigate to "Endpoints" and click "Create endpoint."
Step 2: Provide a name for your endpoint and choose the model you just created.
Step 3: Choose an instance type (e.g., ml.t2.medium) for deployment.
Step 4: Click "Create endpoint."
Purpose: The endpoint allows your model to be accessed via HTTP for inference tasks.

6. Test the Endpoint
Step 1: Once the endpoint status is "InService," navigate to "Endpoint runtime" and select your endpoint.
Step 2: Use the AWS SDK or the SageMaker console to send a test request to your endpoint with sample data.
Step 3: Review the model's prediction to ensure it is working correctly.
Purpose: Verify that your model is deployed correctly and can make predictions.
